# PyChatMan
A simple 'server-client' chat room where clients need to connect to the server and then chat
First run the "server.py". Then by running the "client.py" connect to the server and then do chatting
Note that the server is not a participant but just takes connections. So for chatting creat atleast 2 client using "client.py"
